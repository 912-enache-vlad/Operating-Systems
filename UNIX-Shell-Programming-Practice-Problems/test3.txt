Write a shell program that does the following:
- Gets as parameters N files (N is undefined) which correspond to scheduled appointments in some given days
- Checks whether any appointments in the given files are duplicated (e.g. under the same name and in the same day, and at the same hour)
- The format of the files is as follows (the day is just the day of the year):
firstname;lastname;day;hour
- For the given appointments which are repeated you need to add 1 to the hour (take into account the 24H format, e.g. 23+1 = 0 not 24). If you reached 00 on the next day you should also add 1 to the day and continue onwards.
- Repeat the check until no appointments are duplicated.
- After resolving the issues print the new schedules
- Validate all the given values (e.g. file exists etc.)

Example:
a.txt contents:
a;b;12;5
a;b;12;6
a;b;12;7

b.txt contents:
a;b;12;6

./a.sh a.txt b.txt
a;b;12;8
a;b;12;6
a;b;12;7
a;b;12;5
