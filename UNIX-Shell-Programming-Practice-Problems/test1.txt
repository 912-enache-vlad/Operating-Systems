Write a shell program that does the following:
- Gets a directory from the keyboard
- Gets N files (N is not defined) as parameters.
- Checks whether the files exist in the given directory
- For every file that exists, it will get the number of digits in the last ten lines.
- If the file does not exist, print that it does not exist.
- Validate all the given values (e.g. the directory exists etc.)

Example:
directory is /home/nicu/test
files in the directory are a.txt abcd.txt b.txt c.txt
a.txt contents are
1112
abcd
2322
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h


abcd.txt contents are
aaaaaa
bbbbbb

b.txt contents are
123
123

c.txt contents are
25

The program will be called like this:
./a.sh a.txt abcd.txt bcdef.txt c.txt
/home/bdnicu/test
a.txt:4
abcd.txt:0
bcdef.txt:does not exist
c.txt:2
